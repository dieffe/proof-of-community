# Proof-of-community aka P-oC

The motivation behind Proof-of-community (P-oC) new consensus mechanism is to remove the need of the proof-of-work (P-oW) to ensure consensus and finality to the blocks in the blockchain.

Let's reflect quickly on how and why P-oW is.
P-oW is a very interesting model and to be fair is the closest to the way we give value to FIAT currency. USD has value because there is a valuable asset, gold, backing it up. 
The scarcity of gold gives scarcity to USD. In the crypto world, we need to find a digital way to make the creation of the currency unit expensive somehow.
